So basically i just have created this to approve for the internship simply with the help of html css and javascript i just fetched the database from the omdb but nowadays i don't know why the omdb database is not 
working well and not fetching the data properly but i works simply i created this several months ago for practice and it works but when i saw you needed this for internship so checked it again but it wasn't fetching the data properly but the code is corret so hopefully 
you'll understand and see the code
